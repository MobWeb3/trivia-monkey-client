# Monkey Trivia: The Game Rules

## Objective:
The aim is to be the first monkey to climb to the top of the tree within 50 rounds.

## Getting Started:
- **User Roles:** Each participant becomes a monkey for the game.
- **Host Monkey:** One player serves as the host monkey and initiates the game session.
- **Invite Code:** The host monkey generates an invite code to share with other players.
- **Maximum Players:** Up to 6 monkeys (players) can join the game using the invite code.

## Game Structure:
- **Topic Selection:** Each monkey selects a topic for trivia questions (e.g., "Harry Potter," "Mammals," "Tropical Flowers").
- **Gameboard:** All monkeys start at the base of a virtual tree.

## Gameplay:
- **Initial Turn Order:** At the beginning, each monkey spins a wheel numbered 1-6. The monkey with the highest number goes first. In case of a tie, those tied will spin again to break it.
- **Turn Phases:**
  - **Spin:** On their turn, the monkey spins a wheel to randomly select a topic from the ones chosen.
  - **Question:** The monkey is then asked a trivia question based on the topic selected.
  - **Advancement:** A correct answer allows the monkey to advance one step up the tree. An incorrect answer means the monkey stays in place.
- **Ignorance Monkey:** This is a virtual monkey that moves ahead one step every time a player answers incorrectly.

## Winning:
- **Monkey Winner:** The first monkey to reach the top of the tree within 50 rounds wins.
- **Ignorance Wins:** If the Ignorance Monkey reaches the top before any player does, all players lose.

## User Interface:
- **Spin Wheel Screen:** A dedicated screen displays the wheel during each monkey's spin.
- **Gameboard Screen:** Another screen shows the tree with the avatars of the monkeys at their respective positions.
