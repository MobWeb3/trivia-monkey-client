Let me tell you what the game is about. It's a trivia game. Here are the rules: * Each user is a monkey * This is a board game similar to "maraton de conocimientos" with new features. * Each monkey picks a topic (e.g "Harry Potter", "Mammals", "Tropical flowers") * Monkey can start a session game * The monkey shares an invite code * Other monkeys can join the game up to 6 monkeys if they have the invite code. * The point of the game is to reach the top of a tree. * There is 50 steps to reach the top. * Everyone starts at initial step. * On start every monkey rolls a spinner wheel with numbers 1-6. Whoever gets the biggest number becomes first. Tie numbers do extra spins to break the tie. * First monkey then spins the wheel now to choose a topic. * Monkey is given a question about the topic selected in the spinner wheel or (wheel picker). If question is answered correctly. advances one step. else it stays on the current position. * Previous step repeats until a monkey reaches the top. * The game has a screen to show the wheel when monkey spin it. * The monkey has another screen to show the state of the game (Tree with monkey avatars on different steps of the tree)
